This branch is an attempt to get PTP sync working, based on work from others, I try to cherry pick commits to keep credit

So far it uses PTP to sync but it have a few issues:

re-Syncs often causing some audio skips, however it does not drift, keeps quite well in sync.

PTP Principal 
TL;DR; 
   This branch does not announce itself as a timmingPeer so another AirPlay peer has to do it (e.g. a Home Pod or the iDevice)

TP principal clock (master in PTP terminology), seems to use mac address to select which one will be the principal, i.e. the lowest mac address is selected as principal
This code does not implement PTP principal so it must be connected to another one.

Also when the principal is changed (e.g. if a new peer is added to the group), then time also changes, this is because the "time" used is actually a device arbitrary time (usually device uptime). When this happens this code does not yet update the time properly and stops working too.

# Experimental

Very quick python implementation of AP2 protocol using **minimal
multi-room** features. For now it implements:
- HomeKit transient pairing (SRP/Curve25519/ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- FairPlay (v3) authentication
- Receiving of both REALTIME and BUFFERED Airplay2 audio streams
- Airplay2 Service publication
- Decoding of all Airplay2 supported CODECs: ALAC, AAC, OPUS, PCM.
 Ref: [here](https://emanuelecozzi.net/docs/airplay2/audio/) and 
      [here](https://emanuelecozzi.net/docs/airplay2/rtsp/#setup)
- Output latency compensation for sync with other Airplay receivers

For now it does not implement:
 - MFi Authentication / FairPlay v2 (one of them is required by iTunes/Windows)
 - Audio Sync
 
**This code is experimental. This receiver do not expect to be a real receiver but a toolbox for learning/debugging all airplay protocols and related pairing/authentication methods.** 

Latest additions:
 - Implement RTP buffer (manage FLUSHBUFFERED) : play/pause/timeline/playlist

Next steps:
 - PTP (Precision Time Protocol)
 - Remove all os specific code (Soft Volume management)
 - Sender (branch-sender) - Implementation
 - Implement RSA Authentication
 - Raspbian package
 - DACP/(+MRP?) Support
 - FairPlay v2 Support

## Raspberry Pi 4

Install docker and then build the image:

```zsh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t invano/ap2-receiver .
```

To run the receiver:

```zsh
docker run -it --rm --device /dev/snd --net host invano/ap2-receiver
```

Default network device is wlan0, you can change this with AP2IFACE env variable:

```zsh
docker run -it --rm --device /dev/snd --env AP2IFACE=eth0 --net host invano/ap2-receiver
```

## macOS Catalina

To run the receiver please use Python 3 and do the following:

* Run the following commands

```zsh
brew install python3
brew install portaudio
virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3 proto
source proto/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/Cellar/portaudio/19.6.0/include" --global-option="-L/usr/local/Cellar/portaudio/19.6.0/lib" pyaudio


python ap2-receiver.py -m myap2 --netiface=en0
```

## Windows

To run the receiver please use Python 3 and do the following:

* Run the following commands

```zsh
cd [WHERE_YOU_CLONED_AIRPLAY2_RECEIVER]
virtualenv airplay2-receiver
cd airplay2-receiver
.\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio

python ap2-receiver.py -m myap2 -n [YOUR_INTERFACE_GUID] (looks like this for instance {02681AC0-AD52-4E15-9BD6-8C6A08C4F836} )
```

* the AirPlay 2 receiver is announced as **myap2**.

Tested on Python 3.7.5 / macOS 10.15.2 with iPhone X 13.3 and Raspberry Pi 4
